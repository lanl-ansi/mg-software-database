## Running the website locally

You must have `ruby` / `gem` installed on your machine, for example using `homebrew`:

```sh
brew install rbenv ruby-build
rbenv install 3.3.0
rbenv global 3.3.0
```

Then you need to install jekyll:

```sh
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Then you can run the website:

```sh
jekyll serve --livereload
```
