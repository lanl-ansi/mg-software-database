  "description": "PowerModelsONM focuses on optimizing the operations and restoration of phase unbalanced (multiconductor) distribution feeders that feature multiple grid-forming generation assets such as solar PV, deisel generators, energy storage, etc. Phase unbalanced modeling is achieved using PowerModelsDistribution. This library features a custom implementation of an optimal switching / load shedding (mld) problem. See documentation for more details."
